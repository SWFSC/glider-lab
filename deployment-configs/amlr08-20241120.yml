  comment: 'This glider suffered a leak in its oil pump four days into the deployment and was unable to pump oil into the nose to surface. It aborted at depth and dispatched its emergency ejection weight. It was recovered approximately 12 hours later by a cruise ship and the aft end was severely damaged during the recovery process. '

  summary: "These data are part of the NOAA Ecosystem Science Division Operation Freebyrd. 
            Operation Freebyrd is for glider surveys in the Southern Ocean around the northern Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands.
            Sensors on this glider included a CTD, oxygen sensor, optical sensor, and active acoustic sensor (Nortek) for estimating the biomass of Antarctic krill in important predator foraging areas and fishing areas.
            This glider was scheduled to fly the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program's standard transect from west to east across the Bransfield Strait, but suffered an oil leak 4 days into deployment and required an emergency recovery.
            Prior to recovery, the glider traveled 80.5 km while diving between 20 and 900 m."
